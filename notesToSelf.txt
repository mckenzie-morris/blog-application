-Since node_modules folder is typically not pushed to github (or production), copied the minified 
 bootstrap JS file from node_modules ( node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js ) to 
 the public folder in the root directory. The same was done with the jQuery.min.js

-It is not necessary to import jQuery
  *There are two main module systems in JavaScript: CommonJS and ES6 modules.
   using import statements in ES6 modules, the JavaScript runtime loads the module and evaluates 
   its contents. 
   *ES6 modules use strict mode by default, and they have their own scope, meaning that variables 
    and functions defined within a module are not accessible outside of it unless explicitly 
    exported.
   *jQuery, however, is not designed to be used as an ES6 module. It's traditionally used as a 
    global variable ($ or jQuery) that is accessible throughout your JavaScript code without 
    needing to import it explicitly. This is achieved by including the jQuery library in your 
   *HTML file using a <script> tag.
    when you include jQuery using a <script> tag in your HTML file, it becomes available globally, 
    and you can use it directly in your JavaScript code without needing to import it using ES6 
    module syntax.
